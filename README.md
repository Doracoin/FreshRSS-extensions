# FreshRSS extensions
This repository contains my unfficial FreshRSS extensions.

To install an extension, download the extension archive first and extract it on your PC. 
Then, upload the specific extension(s) you want on your server. 

Extensions must be in the ./extensions directory of your FreshRSS installation.
